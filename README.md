# Pupil Code Test

## What I would have done with more time

I really would of liked more time to complete this task since it is lacking in component unit tests or any integration tests. If I had to do it again I would of focused on getting the components finished faster to at least have the layouts complete.

I did spend some time setting up the dev environment for this project and getting things working to the standards I am accustom to which ate into the time. I don't regret this at all.

My overall plan was to have the MobX store save to the localStorage whenever a property was added, this would simulate a back end. I don't know if this was a good choice as it also ate up some time getting this to work. But it would of been nice to see if finished.

I chose React Create App as a base for this test as it is quick and easy to setup and prototype on. I used Material UI for the component library, this is because I currently use this in my day to day coding and the designs provided matched up well with the look and feel of Material UI.

If I had more time I would put validation in the Add Property page instead of just returning false. I would also refactor the store to work with Promises so that it could be API agnostic.
